# public-api-requests-project
 JavaScript project using APIs and JSON to create an employee directory

This project is a demo of the fetch API in standard JavaScript. It creates a group of 12 employee profile cards on the page with data obtained from a random users endpoint using fetch. Upon click, a more detailed modal card appears with additional user information. A new group of 12 users are fetched from the endpoint upon page refresh.

This project was created as part of the [Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/full-stack-javascript).
